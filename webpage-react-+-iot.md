# Webpage \(React + IoT\)

Chose React as development, React supports IoT projects. The advtange of it is that we don't make use of OOP \(class, object and one inherits from the other...\), React uses compositional structure, meaning we have components and each component is individual, so one component doesn't affect the other. 

Taken from [Iotforall](https://www.iotforall.com/is-react-good-choice-iot-project): Building a component-based application allows you to create two types of components. First, the ones which receive, process, and pass data to child components; second, the components which correspond to IoT sensors.

Lifecycle methods helps IoT systems as well because each update is well monitored because of the component lifecycle, meaning a change on the temperature sensor will trigger a new cycle.
